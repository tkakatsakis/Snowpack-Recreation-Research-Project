          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Backcountry recreation on snow requires adequate snow depth within mountainous areas, and is an increasingly popular activity as well as a highly lucrative component of the winter sports industry. A greatly reduced snowpack will have significant ramifications for backcountry recreation, an activity which will be considered for its economic and societal significance in Washington state. The maritime snowpack of the Washington Cascades is especially susceptible to climate change due to mild temperatures hovering at or near the freezing level, and lower elevation recreation locations are at the greatest risk in the short term. The extent of glaciers in the Cascades Range has already decreased substantially, decreasing 56% in the North Cascades from 1900 to 2009 (Snover et al 2020), and many will disappear completely as ablation from warm temperatures continuously outweighs accumulation from snowfall. Glaciated areas contribute to the uniquely long winter recreation season in the Cascades which stretches into the summer months, and as they melt this will no longer be possible. Additionally, many of the most commonly accessed backcountry recreation areas in the site are located at relatively low elevations, and are at a considerable risk of winter snowfall becoming rain. The ski areas of Washington all have base areas between 3000 and 5000 feet, and as the snowline incrementally increases these areas as well as the subsequent nearby backcountry areas are in jeopardy of too little snowpack to be viable.<br><br>
          The rapid changes in snowpack are juxtaposed with increasingly popular backcountry recreation. More people than ever are backcountry skiing, snowboarding, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, or other forms of recreation on snow. Unprecendented volumes of individuals have taken to the mountains, overcrowding Sno-Parks and other access points. Ski touring specifically has seen an unprecedented increase in popularity in 2020, in part due to uncertainty and restrictions at ski resorts due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a growing outdoor movement. In tandem with the greatly increased usage is an troubling increase of individuals who are uneducated and unprepared for the inherent hazards of snowy mountains. Avalanche education is an essential component of Winter travel, especially in the characteristically steep Cascades mountains. Washington has only suffered a single avalanche fatality in 2021, its first in several years. However outside of Washington this year has been the most tragic on record stretching back to 1910, in part due to the greatest volume of outdoor recreationalist. The industry will undoubtedly undergo significant changes as a result of increased usage and a diminishing snowpack, and the future of winter backcountry recreation in the Washington Cascades is addressed in this site.</p>

          <h2>Dynamics of Social Media</h2>
          <p>The emergence of social media has played a major role in recent changes to backcountry recreation. The abundance of information allows for people to better understand how others are recreated, which comes with a variety of positive and negative effects. Some examples of what is provided by social media is: real time conditions updates, inspiration for trips outdoors, warnings of high danger, learning experience from others mistakes, public shaming for inappropriate behavior, overcrowding of popular spots, and many more. It is apparent that social media has altered backcountry recreation by connecting people. The creation of focused outdoors groups, primarily on Facebook but also on other platforms, connects individuals of similar interests. The ability to meet a stranger online and plan a trip with them provides access for many people that would not otherwise have it. Sharing of rides, expensive outdoor gear, or just the motivation of someone to go with pushes people into the outdoors. Possibly even more influencial than the connections is the idea of shared knowledge. The ability to share information with hundreds or thousands of like-minded people changes the way that the outdoors is approached. After someone discovers an little known location and shares it in a group, all members of the group who read it now also know about it. If even a few of them decide to follow, the spot is now known. Social media has fundementally changed society, including outdoor recreation. <br>

          From a safety perspective, there are notable benefits to shared information. For example, during periods of high avalanche danger in Washington, there are often numerous posts warning people to be conservative in the trips they take. When accidents occur, the story is often shared online. This gives people the opprotunity to learn from the mistakes of others without having actually been in the dangerous situation. Information can be "crowd sourced", with everyone contributing what they personally saw to the larger knowledge base. This idea has been utilized to crowd source snow depth in the backcountry, described in <a href="https://freeskier.com/stories/want-snow-data-step-up-and-help?fbclid=IwAR364T7pwatOVoMJ_uxY2-2Yhbsdawo1AcdydAit5sJAYVOV_rIdPsQcW64" target="_blank">this article</a>. The idea is that people in the backcountry in the Winter will record and submit the depth of snow in the area they are at, to give everyone a better idea of what the snow is like. This is an unusual situation however, as most aggregation of information is informal and disorganized, highly dependent on the groups and sources an individual is a part of. Some avalanche organizations have utilized social media to get their messsage out, described in <a href="https://freeskier.com/stories/avalanche-in-a-world-obsessed-with-social-media-avalanche-centers-are-relying-more-and-more-on-the-attention-grabbing-platforms-to-better-equip-backcountry-skiers?fbclid=IwAR1mMUAapqcEev8VgEzYQuSS0ITjhDJzBk5YOHocOimAN0gpgFzyWfns9Ls" target="_blank">this article</a>. The short attention spans associated with social media forces individuals and organizations to grab your attention with their posts. What gains traction on online platforms is often the most exciting or notable. While posts may spread attention to inherent risks and keep people safer, they may also idolize high risk activities because it creates the best content. There is a motivation to go viral or share something notable on your feed, which can contribute to risk in the backcountry. <br><br>

          Notable social media groups related to Washington backcountry recreation are the Facebook groups: Washington Hikers and Climbers, PNW Peakbaggers, Turns All Year, Pacific Northwest Mountaineers, and PNW Snowmobilers.</p><br><br>


          <h2>COVID-19 Pandemic</h2>
          <p>The COVID-19 Pandemic had a major impact on outdoor recreation that it has pushed people outside. With many events and activities in the city shut down people have taken to the outdoors for entertainment. A greater appreciation and experiencing of the outdoors by the general population is certainly not a bad thing, but in some cases area have been unable to keep up with the increased usage. In Washington, all three National Parks (Mount Rainier, Olympic, North Cascades) have adopted a new backcountry camping permit system in 2021 to cap the increased usage in several areas. The boom in pandemic ski recreation is discussed in <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/outdoors/a-pandemic-winter-foretells-a-backcountry-skiing-boom-but-its-not-a-sport-to-take-lightly/?fbclid=IwAR00ZccjadTTSd5GRathnvdHwAbnRxiOLo0Vk50_mXv3qR7451iCxxS5tUY" target="_blank">a Seattle Times article</a><br>, which describes how avalanche classes in late 2020 were completely sold out, and backcountry safety gear impossible to find. <br>

          <h2>Overcrowding</h2>
          <p>For many people, the appeal of the outdoors, especially in the Winter, is in the peace and quiet that you will find. Escaping the busy cities to wander among the empty snowy mountains is relaxing and rejuvinating. Unfortunatately, this is countary to overcrowding which has become increasingly problematic in certain outdoor spaces. ...<br>

          <h2>Case Study and Personal Accounts</h2>
          <h3>1. Alpental Valley, Snoqualmie Pass</h3>
          <p>One of the most troubling and popular sites for backcountry recreation in Washington state lies just a few miles away from Interstate I90, just off of Snoqualmie Pass. The Alpental valley, containing the South fork of the Snoqualmie River, is traveled by thousands of individuals every Winter. The popularity of the area makes sense; it is one hour away from the Seattle area, it is accessed from the Alpental Ski Area which currently recieves an average of over 400 inches of snowfall each season, and the area contains extremely steep and beautiful terrain.</p><br>
          <p>Tragically, the Alpental valley has been the location of seven fatalities due to avalanche, and undoutably many more close calls. Additionally, as a result of overcrowding several measures have been taken. A designated uphill route have been created up the valley both for safety and logistics. Warning and information signage has been put up in several locations, and parking has been restricted in the closest parking lot to resort skiers. The popular route to Source lake, and optionally up to snow lake, is likely the most commonly traveled winter route in the state.</p>

          <p>In February 2021 a widespread avalanche cycle occured in the Cascade range. It resulted from a notable weak layer in the snowpack from a crust in mid January, which was unable to heal due to cold temperatures and continuous snowfall. The existance of this danger was well documented among the outdoor community, but many individuals still chose to travel underneath avalanche terrain and one fatality was recorded. In the above picture, the terrain of the Alpental valley can be seen as well as massive collections of avalanche debree underneath nearly every steep slope. The textured snow surface visible, as well as a large pile on the edge of Snow Lake in the shade, contain the aftermath of the dangerous cycle of avalanches.

          <p>One slide in particular was shockingly destructive, unpredicted, and lucky that no one was involved. This persistent slab avalanche triggered naturally on the East aspect of Chair peak during the night. It ran thousands of feet into the valley below, completely coverering the above mentioned highly popular backcountry route up the valley. Several groups were present in the area the day before the slide, unawawre of the possibility of this highly consequential event. Had it occured 12 hours earlier or later, surely there would have been fatalities.</p>

          <p>Fresh avalanche debree near Source Lake. Two individuals can be seen climbing up next to the debree, in danger of an additional slide.</p><br><br>
          <p>In a personal trip to the area in April I observed a similar and concerning scene. My group was aware that there had been a recent natural slide, and intended to stick to sheltered slopes during a brief morning trip. As we arrived at Source Lake we saw 5+ parties. Several of them mentioned that they were unaware of these conditions and turned around, while others continued directly up the avalanche debree. In the image one group can be seen right on the edge of the debree, risking the possibility of a second event. One individual was alone, without safety gear, undettered by the scene and in route to "Avalanche Mountain". It is possible that these individuals have recently taken up backcountry recreation and are unaware, and it is also possible that they are experienced and have a different risk tolerance or perspective on the situation as I did. However I found it to be very frightening to see so many people unaware of unbothered by the signifigant risks they were choosing to take. Fortunately, no additional slides were recorded this day and everyone made it out safe.</p><br><br>

          <p>The following week however, 5 notable human triggered avalanches occured in the Alpental valley. Two of them caught and carried skiers, with one full burial. There were no serious injuries. April snowfall blanketed the stable Spring slopes with unconsolidated powder snow, and complacency that the avalanche season was over likely contributed to this string of accidents. The Alpental valley is a hotspot for backcountry skiers, and April 2021 once again had several extremely close calls in this one specific area. The fact that there was not a more serious incident here in 2021 is in my opinion very lucky, and only a matter of time before a fatality occurs.


          <h3>2. The Wasatch Range, Utah</h3>
          <p>Travelling outside the Cascades during 2021, I witnessed backcountry recreation in the Wasatch range near Salt Lake Ciy, Utah. This is one of the most popular locations for backcountry skiing in the nation.</p><br><br><br>
