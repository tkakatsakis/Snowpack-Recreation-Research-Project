        <h2>Abstract</h2><br>
        <p> The Cascades mountains of the Pacific Northwest are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and increases in temperature have led to decreased snow and an uncertain future. A reduced snowpack has significant ramifications for the evolving ski and backcountry Winter recreation industry in Washington state. This research considers a changing natural landscape and its hydrological processes in the face of global climate change, from the lens of backcountry recreation. Geospatial analysis quantifies the extent to which the snowpack of the Cascades has been impacted by temperature increases using snow data from the NOHRSC and SNOTEL sites, and models its future state given predicted climate scenarios. The dynamics of winter backcountry recreation are discussed including increased usage, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, avalanche awareness and risk, and the existential threat to Pacific Northwest Winter recreation when mountain snowfall becomes rain.</p><br><br>
        <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
        <p>This study investigates the effects of projected temperature increases on the snowpack of the Washington Cascades with respect to backcountry recreation. The Cascade Range within the Pacific Northwest receives a high volume of precipitation, much of it falling as snow at medium to high elevations during the Winter season. Springtime melt from the Winter snowfall is an important component to the region's hydrological cycles, and these processes have undergone disruptions from diminished snowfall amounts in the long term. This is attributed to increased temperatures resulting from global climate change, creating a diminished mountain snowpack in the region among other significant impacts. The driving force behind this temperature change is increases in atmospheric CO2, reaching levels above 405 parts per million in 2019 after being less than 300 ppm for at least 800,000 years (Snover 2019, IPCC Special Report and Implications for Washington State). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that current rates of warming will continue, reaching global levels of 1.5° C warmer as soon as the year 2030 (Snover 2019), and much higher by the end of the century. The damaging effects of this warming are severe for the maritime climate of Washington state, including projected sea level rise, increased very hot days, and a reduced snowpack leading to water shortages and winter recreation losses. This study will specifically address the impacts of climate change on the snowpack of the Cascades, and its implications for backcountry winter recreation in the area.</p> <br>
        <p>Backcountry recreation on snow requires adequate snow depth within mountainous areas, and is an increasingly popular activity as well as a highly lucrative component of the winter sports industry. A greatly reduced snowpack will have significant ramifications for backcountry recreation, an activity which will be considered for its economic and societal significance in Washington state. The maritime snowpack of the Washington Cascades is especially susceptible to climate change due to mild temperatures hovering at or near the freezing level, and lower elevation recreation locations are at the greatest risk in the short term. Areas such Snoqualmie Pass, a highly popular access point for resort skiing and backcountry recreation which sits at an elevation just over 3000 feet, may no longer be viable for winter recreation in the coming decades as a greater percentage of Winter precipitation falls as rain instead of snow. Additionally, the extent of glaciers in the Cascades Range has already decreased substantially, and many will disappear completely as ablation from warm temperatures continuously outweighs accumulation from snowfall. Glaciated areas allow for a uniquely long ski season in the Cascades into the summer months, and as they melt this will no longer be possible. The rapid changes in snowpack are juxtaposed with increasingly popular backcountry recreation in the state. More people than ever are backcountry skiing, snowboarding, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, or other forms of recreation on snow. Ski touring specifically has seen an unprecedented increase in popularity in 2020, in part due to uncertainty and restrictions at ski resorts due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a growing outdoor movement. The industry will undoubtedly undergo significant changes as a result of increased usage and a diminishing snowpack, and this study will address and discuss the future of winter backcountry recreation in the Washington Cascades.

        <h2>Research Context</h2><br>
        <p>The impacts of increased temperatures and the future of the backcountry recreation industry in Washington fills a niche subject area. Reviewing the existing literature, relevant publications place the hydrological processes of the Pacific Northwest into the context of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s reports (Roop et. al. 2020, Snover et. al. 2019). Additionally, academic studies quantify the observed and expected changes to snowpack in mountain environments (Helgason 2016; Sproles et. al. 2013; Mote et. al. 2018), though models vary greatly in their inputs and results and there is little consensus as to the exact timeframes or extent to which snowpack in the region will decrease. <br>
        From the perspective of the ski industry, Washington is highly vulnerable to the impacts of increased temperatures. Protect Our Winters, a climate advocate nonprofit, has published several reports describing the economic losses to the ski industry due to climate change. In response to low snow years, they have found that Washington has shown a 31% reduction of skier visits and an average difference of negative 92 million dollars value added, which is the greatest and second greatest loss of any U.S. state respectively. (Hagenstad et. al. 2018) Little research has been published addressing the impacts of backcountry specific recreation, and my project seeks to fill this gap. The unprecedented increase in backcountry usage this year has been well documented from news sources such as the Seattle Times (Scruggs 2020), however this outlook for the industry in the face of climate change has not been addressed. No comprehensive published research has tied together the decreased snowpack of Washington, the economic contributions of backcountry recreation in the state, and the changing industry and its future.</p>
